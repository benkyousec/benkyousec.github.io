I'm Marcus, and welcome to my little corner on the Internet ^_^
I started this blog to document my learning progress in cybersecurity, and it also acts as a reference for when I have to look up something that I've done before.

I play CTFs with [RE:UN10N](https://reun10n.team/) and you can find my other writeups on [our GitHub](https://github.com/rehackxyz/REUN10N/tree/main/CTF-writeups).
